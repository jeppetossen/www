# Collection of web projects

The purpose of these is to teach me web development / web designing.

## Startpage
My very first project, just a basic homepage.

## Storage
Recently the need for a NAS at home has increased. 
So I wanted to do a web-interface for the NAS for easy access wherever I am.
